This repository is for any documents used and submitted when completing the course "SQL for Data Science" from UC Davis.

SQLPeerReview was an assignment I did as part of the SQL course offered by UCDavis. It was the final assignment and showcases my understanding
of the language through basic analysis conducted through an ER Diagram. The ER Diagram is also uploaded, named 'ERDiagram_Course'.
