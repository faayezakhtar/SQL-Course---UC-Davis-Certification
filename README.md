This repository is for any reports or projects I do using SQL to practice and explore the language. 

SQLPeerReview was an assignment I did as part of the SQL course offered by UCDavis. It was the final assignment and showcases my understanding
of the language through basic analysis conducted through an ER Diagram. The ER Diagram is also uploaded, name 'ERDiagram_Course'.
